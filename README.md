# Background Story

Last day, my colleague Jacky wore this T-shirt. We were all scratching our heads and thinking what this words can be!!

This kept passing through my head so often that I couldn't rest without solving this puzzle. So, then I realised it's a common problem, when we try to think of a word and can't find it. It's annoying. So, I quicly wrote a python program to find out words like these whenever we get ourselves in trouble.
