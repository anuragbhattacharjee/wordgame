# Background Story

Last day, my colleague Joseph Jacky wore this T-shirt. We were all scratching our heads and thinking what this word can be!!

I couldn't get it off my head. Then I realized it's a common problem when we try to think of a word and can't find it. It's annoying. So, I quickly wrote a python program to find out the word and solve all word puzzles once and for all. So use it at your convenience.
